# Welcome
This GitHub Repo is a collection of different coding skills & projects that I have attempted to learn and apply over the years. 
Inside the repo you can find anything from search & sort algorithms to Arduino application projects. The repo is designed to be 
a reference to for anyone to come and look at as well as hopefully use in your own projects. Happy coding!
